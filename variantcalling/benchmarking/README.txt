Utilities for comparing performance of various variant calling tools.

We use sample NA24385 AJ Son because:
- Genome in a Bottle truth set exists for SNPs and small INDELs
- GiaB has an additional SV truth set that is only available for AJ Son (as of 12/2018)
- Parent genomes are available so trio calling is possible
- High-quality data sets are available for many sequencing platforms at ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/AshkenazimTrio/HG002_NA24385_son
